Once upon a time, I was an university teacher.

For some reason, it was too much work for the network admins to create mailing lists
for each student class/group.

Luckily, at the begining, there was a student manager system (Akademos) with a SOAP API
where I could get all the students names from a group and then query LDAP for their email
addresses with a simple script, creating a text file that I could paste on my email client
to create the mailing list.

Later, they decided to change the system and I no longer had access to the SOAP API. I had
to read the students names from an OpenOffice Calc spreadsheet and then query LDAP to get
the email addresses and create my mailing list.
